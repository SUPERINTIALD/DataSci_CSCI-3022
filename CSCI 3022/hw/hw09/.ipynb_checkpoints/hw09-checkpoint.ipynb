However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",

    "Q1.1\n",
    "Scientists may misuse p values through p-hacking, misinterpreation of pvalues, and overreliance on pvalues to see the size of an effect.\n",
    "Through p-hacking, researchers may perform multiple tests and selectively report only that produces statsistacally significant results, while not reporting the others that didn't show significance. In misinterpreation of pvalues, they may use pvalues as a direct measure of importance or proabbiltiy of a hypothesis being true. Finally, some researchers may rely soley on p-values to make decisions without considering other statisical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1.2\n",
    "To use p-values properly, the article suggests that researchers must report effect size effect with p-values. This provides information about the significance of the results, and helps determine if a result is statistically significant. Another way way is to not use p-values to determine if the hypothesis is correct or incorrect. They shouldn't be used as a base to determine conclusions. Finally, the misinterpretation of p-values and misuse of p-values needs to be fixed, and needs to be understood correctly.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q1.3\n",
    "In null hypothesis for a single test, the probability of not incorrectly rejcting the null hypothesis is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. There are n number of tests. And we want to see the minimum number of tests occured that it is 50% likely that at least one of the tests will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. Thus we can use the equation:\n",
    "\n",

    "The Bonferroni correction is a method to address the problem of multiple comparisons by adjusting the significance level for individual tests to maintain a desired overall significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are conducting 10 tests and you want to maintain an overall significance level of 5%, you would adjust the significance level for each individual test to 0.5% (0.05 / 10). If any individual test yields a p-value less than 0.5%, it would be considered statistically significant. This correction helps control the family-wise error rate, ensuring that the overall probability of making at least one Type I error remains low.\n"

However, if we suspect that the die might be unfair based on the data, we can conduct a hypothesis test using TVD to compare the expected [$\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$] distribution to what is actually observed.\n",

We first calculate the mean length of caddisflies at higher altitudes, then randomly shuffle out data and select without replacement. Then we do the same for the lower altitude.

    "## Question 4: Deflategate\n",
    "\n",
    "On January 18, 2015, the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots played the American Football Conference (AFC) championship game to determine which of those teams would play in the Super Bowl. After the game, there were allegations that the Patriots' footballs had not been inflated as much as the regulations required; they were softer. This could be an advantage, as softer balls might be easier to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several weeks, the world of American football was consumed by accusations, denials, theories, and suspicions: the press labeled the topic Deflategate, after the Watergate political scandal of the 1970's. The National Football League (NFL) commissioned an independent analysis. In this example, we will perform our own analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure is often measured in pounds per square inch (psi). NFL rules stipulate that game balls must be inflated to have pressures in the range 12.5 psi and 13.5 psi. Each team plays with 12 balls. Teams have the responsibility of maintaining the pressure in their own footballs, but game officials inspect the balls. Before the start of the AFC game, all the Patriots' balls were at about 12.5 psi. Most of the Colts' balls were at about 13.0 psi. However, these pre-game data were not recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the second quarter, the Colts intercepted a Patriots ball. On the sidelines, they measured the pressure of the ball and determined that it was below the 12.5 psi threshold. Promptly, they informed officials. \n",
    "\n",
    "At half-time, all the game balls were collected for inspection. Two officials, Clete Blakeman and Dyrol Prioleau, measured the pressure in each of the balls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the data. Each row corresponds to one football. Pressure is measured in psi. The Patriots ball that had been intercepted by the Colts was not inspected at half-time. Nor were most of the Colts' balls – the officials simply ran out of time and had to relinquish the balls for the start of second half play."

    "We can see that the observed difference in pressure drop between the Patriots's and Colt's footballs is statistically significant at a 5% significance level, thus we can reject the null hypothesis. We can say that on average, the Patriots have a larger drop in pressure compared to Colt's football, and the difference is unlikely due to chance. However, the observed difference could be due to various factors, and the test only tells us that there is a statistical difference but doesn't show the causes of the difference. We will need to know more in order to identify the reaons for the observed difference in pressure drop between the two team."

    "“The average pressure drop of the Patriots game balls exceeded the average pressure drop of the Colts balls by 0.45 to 1.02 psi, depending on various possible assumptions regarding the gauges used, and assuming an initial pressure of 12.5 psi for the Patriots balls and 13.0 for the Colts balls.”  (Investigative report commissioned by the NFL regarding the AFC Championship game on January 18, 2015)\n",

    "Our analysis shows an average pressure drop of about 0.73 psi, which is close to the center of the interval “0.45 to 1.02 psi” and therefore consistent with the official analysis.\n",
